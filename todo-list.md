# Todo List for Security Monitor

**High Priority**
- Use systemctd instead of screen to run it in background
- Using IPTables to block a IP instead of shutting SSH down (the system administrator cant log in anymore with SSH)
- Using a other way to get the logs (journal or smth)

**Mid Priority**
- More functions
- Prettier
